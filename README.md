# probability

Probability is very difficult to understand. It is easy to calculate wrong, and the mathematics for it are
above most peoples understanding. I myself keep picking the wrong answers if I just rely on what I read and
what would seem to be correct.

I like to verify things programmatically. It is usually easier to understand the logic in a test than in
mathematical equations. It does not prove anything, but it gives us an easy way of seeing some numbers. And it
is much easier to understand numbers and equations.

This repo will try to include a lot of typical probability questions an average person could think of.

### Picking same numbers vs picking different numbers

Is it smart to pick the same numbers each week, or should you pick different numbers? What is best?

*Answer*

Each run tests 10000 rounds of first winner

run | same | different
--- | --- | ---
1 | 5036 | 4964
2 | 4978 | 5022

I guess it does not really matter what you do, there is no real difference.
